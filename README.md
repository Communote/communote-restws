# About
The Communote Rest Web-Service project uses [Xtext](https://eclipse.org/Xtext/) to define a domain-specific language with 
which a REST API can be modeled. Apart from the DSL, the project also includes a generator and an Eclipse plugin for editing 
REST API models which are based on the DSL. The generator can be used to create server-side Java base classes for the REST API 
implementation, a Java REST API client and documentation from a model.
